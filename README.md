MM314 Rig Design

A project aimed at improving the experience of students for the module MM314: Sustainable Processes (Design Project)
An on-board arduino is fitted to the rig with sensors to take accurate real time data from students' solutions and store them in the cloud for analysis.
This extends the scope of the project to offer students the oppurtunity to stream this data to their power management system and therefore incorporate a dynamic SCADA process.
User feedback in the form of gauges, graphs, and system alerts.
